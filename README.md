# Work/Life

An Ember application, this is a personal blog I have been working on with some of my friends.  We've always disliked that we can't build our own website, so I've done it now.  

Ember seems easiest for simple web applcations such as blogs/news sites.  If you want something more complicated, I think it is best to move toward Angular.  Checkout my recipeKeeper for a good example of Angular.
